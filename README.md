# Racial Equity Impact Statement: Lakeview Amphitheater

The Racial Equity Impact Statement (REIS) is a joint effort by [Legal Services of Central New York (LSCNY)](https://www.lscny.org/) and the [Urban Jobs Task Force (UJTF)](http://www.ujtf.org/) to provide data-enabled recommendations for employers designed to ameliorate racial disparities in hiring practices for publicly-funded construction projects. 

The present repository contains [22 redacted, preprocessed tables](https://github.com/jamisoncrawford/lakeview/tree/master/Preprocessed%20Workbooks%20-%20Redacted) for construction workers involved in the 2014-2015 renovation of [Lakeview Amphitheater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeview_Amphitheater). These data were manually scraped and delivered to the analyst by LSCNY, as well as [their manually reformatted text files](https://github.com/jamisoncrawford/lakeview/tree/master/Reformatted%20CSVs%20-%20Redacted), with uniform variables containing the original data (barring `address`) and metadata variables to prevent information loss, e.g. .xlsx color-coding and commentary. Records from an additional 6 contractors, due to their size, are pending automated scraping via R.

Table names and variable definitions for each document are located in *codebook.md* in the master branch.
